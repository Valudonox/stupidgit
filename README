Installation
============

Simply clone the StupidGit repository to any place you want.

To run StupidGit, you will need the following packages:
- Python >= 2.5
  - Windows: http://www.python.org/download/
  - Ubuntu Linux: installed by default
  - OS X: installed by default
- wxPython >= 2.8
  - Windows: http://www.wxpython.org/download.php
  - Ubuntu Linux: apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8
  - OS X: installed by default
- Git >= 1.6
  ... if this is not installed yet, you probably don't need this program ;)
  StupidGit is tested with the standard git-core package on Ubuntu,
  the MacPorts git-core package on OS X and msysgit on Windows.

StupidGit will search git binary on the following locations:
- PATH
- on Unix platforms: /opt/local/bin (for MacPorts)
- on Windows: C:\Program Files\Git\bin (default path for msysgit)

Running StupidGit
=================

On unix systems it is useful to create a symlink to
<StupidGit_dir>/bin/stupidgit from a directory which is in the PATH. If you
invoke stupidgit from a directory which is inside a git repository, it will
open that repo by default (just as gitk does).

On Windows, double-click on <StupidGit_dir>/bin/run.py. This will open the
StupidGit repository by default, but you can open another repository easily :)

Development
